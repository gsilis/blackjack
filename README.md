# Simple Blackjack

Simple version of the game, not quite done yet. No UI, JS console only.

## Installation

This uses (vite)[https://vitejs.dev/] to bootstrap and run.

1. Pull down the repo.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start dev`.
1. Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## WIP Running the Game

In console, store the result of `setupGame()` into a variable. The result is an instance of the `game/game.js` object.
